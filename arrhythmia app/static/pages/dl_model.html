    This app uses a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
    to automatically detect arrhythmia from ECG data. The CNN model is trained to 
    recognize patterns in heartbeats and classify them as normal or abnormal. 
    It helps in early diagnosis and monitoring of heart conditions through accurate 
    and fast analysis of ECG signals.
